    <h1>Exercise 2.2</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>In exercise 5 of the last practical, you were asked to create a character using 2D shapes. In this exercise, you're going to 
                use variables to animate your character to move with the mouse. Copy the contents of last practical's <strong>exercise5/sketch.js</strong> into 
                this folder's <strong>sketch.js</strong>. If you put last week's practical in your filestore, you should be able to access it on the 
                any lab computer. If not, you can find all module repositories you have access to here: <a href="https://github.com/UoY-PDM1-2526" target="_blank">https://github.com/UoY-PDM1-2526</a>. 
                As you only need the contents of one file, you do not need to clone the whole of last week's practical again. Navigate to the file you 
                need in your browser and copy its contents.
            </p>
            <p>In your original code, the x and y locations of all the shapes that make up your creature were hardcoded. Modify your sketch so that your creature moves with the mouse. </p>
            <h3>Suggested steps</h3>
            <p>
                Pick a component of your character to be its centre point--the point that will eventually be under the mouse. In <code>draw()</code>, create 
                two new <em>local</em> variables called centreX and centreY and initialise them with the centre point of your character. For example, I 
                picked my character's torso to be the centre point. The coordinates of his torso were 400, 350, so my code for centreX and centreY is:<br>
                <code>let centreX = 400;</code><br>
                <code>let centreY = 350;</code>
            </p>
            <p>Replace the hardcoded x and y coordinates of your character's centre shape with your new variables.</p>
            <p>Next, go through each shape that makes up your character and convert its x and y coordinates from hardcoded numbers 
                to calculations relative to the centreX and centreY variables. For example, my character's head was drawn as follows:<br>
                <code>rect(400, 235, 60, 70);</code> <br>
                ...which can be converted to:<br>
                <code>rect(centreX, centreY - 115, 60, 70);</code>
            </p>
            <p>When you are done with the above steps, your character should appear exactly the same as the original character.</p>
            <p>Now you're ready to make it move with the mouse. Change the intitialisations of centreX and centreY to initialise 
                the variables with <code>mouseX</code> and <code>mouseY</code>:<br>
                <code>let centreX = mouseX;</code><br>
                <code>let centreY = mouseY;</code>
            </p>
            <p><em>Note: using the local variables centreX and centreY makes the conversion from hardcoded coordinates to relative 
                coordinates easier. Now that the process is complete, the variables are redundant. If you feel so inclined, you could 
                get rid of centreX and centreY altogether, and just use mouseX and mouseY in their place when the shapes 
                are called. 
            </em></p>
